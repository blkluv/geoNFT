GeoNFT is a blockchain-based game where brands and creators can airdrop Geo-location based NFTs. Users need to move around in the real world to collect these NFTs using the clues they get.

GeoNFT is a unique play-to-earn game where users explore places in the real world just like a treasure hunt and earn NFTs. These NFTs can be viewed in AR bringing in a metaverse-like experience.

This platform can be used by companies and creators for branding events and driving masses to their stores, exhibitions, and other such events.
